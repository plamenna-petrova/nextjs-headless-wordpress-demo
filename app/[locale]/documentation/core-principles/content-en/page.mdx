# WordPress Features

WordPress works as a content management system based on the ,,Headless'' architecture, using its API to deliver content to external applications 
developed with software frameworks and libraries. {{ className: "lead" }}

## Types of CMS

Content Management Systems (CMS) can be classified into three main categories

- **Traditional Content Management Systems**:
  - are conceptualized and developed as platforms designed to facilitate the creation and publication of HTML-based content on the Internet
  - feature an integrated architecture that manages the entire content lifecycle
  - are suitable for users without in-depth technical knowledge

    className="my-4 mx-auto"
    maxFigureWidth={'400px'}
    loading="lazy" 
  />

- **Content management systems based on the ,,Headless'' architecture**:
  - change the paradigm in the way digital content is managed and delivered
  - separate the content management process from its presentation layer, using application programming interfaces and removing the dependency on specific software frameworks
  - allow content to be distributed seamlessly to different endpoints, for example: mobile applications and wearable technologies
  - software developers can adapt the presentation layer to the unique requirements of each platform or device, personalizing user interfaces and improving the user experience

    maxFigureWidth={'600px'}
    loading="lazy" 
  />

- **Hybrid Content Management Systems**:
  - combine the advantages of the "Headless" architecture with the convenience of traditional content management systems, offering a flexible and universal platform for creating and managing content
  - provide intuitive tools for easy updating and modification of content
  - allow the creation of user interfaces in software frameworks according to the developers' preference
  - unify all functionalities into a single system, overcoming the problems associated with inconsistency and additional work inherent in using separate platforms

## WordPress

WordPress can be considered a hybrid content management system depending on how it is configured and used. By default, WordPress is a traditional content management system, where the backend and frontend are connected to each other. However, with the introduction of an application programming interface for communication over HTTP/HTTPs protocols and the REST style of software architecture for implementing web services, WordPress can also function as a content management system based on the ,,Headless'' architecture, which makes it a universal hybrid solution.

## Next.js Software Framework

Next.js is a robust software framework based on the React software framework that improves the process of building websites in relation to the following aspects:

<TABLE striped={false}>
  <TBODY>
    <TR>
      <TD> Responsive design</TD>
      <TD> Integration of responsive design libraries to adapt to different devices and screen sizes. Provides an attractive visual experience on all platforms.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD> Improved user experience</TD>
      <TD> Intuitive navigation, fast page loading, and smooth transitions reduce time to complete actions and increase user satisfaction.</TD>

## The meaning of UX

- User Experience (UX) refers to the user's interaction with a website, application, or digital platform. It encompasses all aspects of the interaction - from functionality and usability to visual design and emotional perception.
- The main goal of user experience is to create a comfortable and intuitive environment that meets the needs of users, while satisfying and engaging them.
- A good user experience leads to a longer stay on a particular website, application, or digital platform.
- Methods for measuring user experience include usability metrics, user feedback, data analysis tools, and real-time usability tests.
- Methods for improving user experience include: user-centered design, intuitive navigation, mobile compatibility, and responsive design, conducting regular testing and analysis, and adhering to web accessibility standards.

    </TR>
  </TBODY>
</TABLE>

- The integration of WordPress and Next.js provides a robust approach to building dynamic and interactive websites or applications, leveraging the strengths of both platforms.
- In this configuration, Next.js serves as the frontend, retrieving content from WordPress using API standards such as the REST style of software architecture or the GraphQL query language and framework.
- Next.js enables faster load times, improved SEO performance, and the design of more responsive user interfaces, while WordPress excels in its robust content management.
- By adopting a "Headless" architecture, developers can streamline workflows and ensure an optimized experience across platforms - from websites to mobile and progressive applications.
- The collaboration of WordPress and Next.js represents a shift from monolithic systems to more modular, efficient, and scalable web architectures, offering a modern solution for enterprise websites or applications that require scalability and high performance.

## Progressive Web Apps

- Built using web platform technologies, but provide a user experience similar to that of a platform-specific application.
- Improve user experience
- Provide offline capabilities
- Improved performance through the use of modern APIs and caching mechanisms
