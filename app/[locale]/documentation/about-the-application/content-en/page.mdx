# Analysis of the current progressive web application developed with Next.js and WordPress

Description of the application's purpose, methodology and architecture {{ className: "lead" }}

## Research tasks

- Investigate how the separation of the frontend (Next.js) and backend (WordPress) affects scalability, maintainability and performance.
- Investigate how specific features such as offline access, fast loading and mobile design improve the user experience.
- Determine how well the WordPress API supports real-time content updates and what is the level of security of the communication between the frontend (Next.js) and backend (WordPress).
- Encouraging learning through content creation: students from the Bachelor's programs Software Engineering (2nd year) and Information Brokerage and Digital Media (3rd year) full-time study document their coursework in the disciplines Content Management Systems and Software and Media Ergonomics, respectively, which they upload as publications to a WordPress web instance and visualize in the progressive web application.
